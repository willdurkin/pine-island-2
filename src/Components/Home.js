            Whether your son is shy or gregarious, big or small, this camp will challenge 
            him to be at his best and instill the quiet confidence that comes from 
            personal achievement.

            Pine Island Camp was founded in 1902 by Clarence Colby on Pine Island, 
            a beautiful small island in Great Pond, the largest of the Belgrade Lakes 
            in central Maine. Colby's original ideas and ideals are very much present at
             Pine Island today, and the philosophy he established is as important and 
            relevant to young people today as it was over 100 years ago.</p>

          <h2>Nightly Campfire and Saturday Night Show</h2>
          <p>
            Every night we have campfire, during which skits, songs, stories, and games keep everyone amused. At this time, the Black and White Knights and their hideous assistants may appear to duel in canoes as they have for decades. A hirsute Esther Williams and her water nymphs might perform some synchronized swimming. Or perhaps Johnny Credit Card will perform one of his memorable ballads. Participation in Campfire is open to everyone and provides an opportunity for creativity and self-expression that is increasingly rare in today's digital world.
