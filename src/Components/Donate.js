				<h3>Donate by Mail</h3>
				<p>Checks can be made out to:</p>
				<p>Pine Island Camp</p>
				<p>P.O. Box 242</p>
				<p>Brunswick, ME 04011</p>

				<h3>Donate Gifts and Securities</h3>
				<p>Stocks, bonds or mutual funds that have appreciated in value are a particularly attractive gift from a tax viewpoint because you may get favorable treatment of capital gains. If you give Pine Island securities that you have held for more than 12 months, you will receive an income tax deduction for their full fair-market value, and you will not have to pay capital gains taxes on their increased value over the original investment. For instructions on how to make gifts of securities please contact Sarah Hunter by email (shunter@pineisland.org) or phone (207-465-3031).
				</p>

				<h3>Bequests</h3>
				<p>Once you have provided in your will for the people you love, you may wish to consider a bequest to Pine Island. A bequest could take either of these forms:
				</p>
				<p>A specific bequest</p>
				<p>"I devise and bequeath to Pine Island Camp, located in Belgrade Lakes, Maine, the sum of $___________ (or __________% of my estate) to be used for the Camp's general charitable purposes."
				</p>
				<p>A residuary bequest</p>
				<p>"I devise and bequeath to Pine Island Camp, located in Belgrade Lakes, Maine, all (or specify __________%) of the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, whether real, personal or mixed, to be used for the Camp's general charitable purposes."
				</p>

				<h3>Beneficiary Designation</h3>
				<p>You can help ensure that the Pine Island experience remains available to future generations by designating the camp as beneficiary of an investment or retirement account, a life insurance policy or a donor-advised fund, among others.
				</p>
				<p>You can determine the percentage of assets you designate for Pine Island on a form that is entirely separate from your will. Not only is this an easy way to make a legacy gift, but it's also flexible—you aren't locked into the choices you make today. It's easy to put a beneficiary designation in place. Contact your account administrator to obtain the correct form or visit your fund's website.
				</p>
				<h3>Life Insurance</h3>
				<p>When the original purpose for a life insurance policy no longer applies—such as educating children now grown or providing financial security for a spouse now deceased—your policy can become a powerful and simple way to support the camp you love. There are two ways to give life insurance to Pine Island:
				</p>
				<p>Name Pine Island Camp as a beneficiary of the policy. This gift is as simple as updating your beneficiary designation form with the policy holder. You can designate Pine Island as the primary beneficiary for a percentage or specific amount. You can also make Pine Island the contingent beneficiary so that it will receive the balance of your policy only if your primary beneficiary doesn't survive you.
				</p>
				<p>Make an outright gift of a new or existing policy. You can make an irrevocable gift to Pine Island by naming the camp as owner and beneficiary of a policy. You may receive a federal charitable deduction for your gift. A gift of life insurance can be an attractive way to leave a legacy that will contribute to the lives of future Pine Islanders just as Pine Island contributed to yours.
				</p>

				<h3>Sloan Critchfield Boat Maintenance Workshop Weekend · September 16-19, 2022</h3>
				<p>Pine Island's annual Sloan Critchfield Memorial Boat Maintenance Workshop is a volunteer event that brings alumni, campers, parents, and friends together to honor the memory of Pine Islander Sloan Critchfield by working to preserve our fleet of wooden boats. Dozens of Pine Islanders have generously given their time during Belgrade's beautiful fall to take part in this event. Everyone who has participated has loved the experience—the sense of accomplishment, the camaraderie, the food, the fall weather, and of course Great Pond.
				</p>
				<p>The work will be varied and includes: working on our fleet of wooden boats—everything from repairing gunnels and dagger board trunks, to the sanding and painting that keep our boats shipshape—light carpentry, painting, cutting firewood, landscaping, and more.
					We will provide three excellent meals per day and will be sure that you are comfortable in one of the several cabins on Pine Island. Bring a sleeping bag, a towel, some work clothes, and work gloves and join us for some great times in September on Pine Island.
					Volunteers are welcome to come for the day or for the whole weekend. The first meal will be dinner on Friday and the last meal will be breakfast on Monday.
					If you're interested in joining us for the Sloan Critchfield Memorial Boat Maintenance Workshop, please contact our Operations Director, Miles Frank at mfrank@pineisland.org. Thank you!
					</p>
