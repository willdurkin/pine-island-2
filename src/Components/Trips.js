		         Over half of Pine Island's camping trips are backpacking trips, and most are designed to summit one or several mountains in Maine or New Hampshire. Younger boys camp at the base of mountains like Saddleback or Mt. Washington and day hike to the summit without packs. Older boys carry their packs from campsite to campsite, on routes that take them over summits and along ridges above the tree line.
