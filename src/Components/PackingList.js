			<h3>Packing List</h3>
			<strong>What is your Packing List????</strong>
			<p>
			We accept 85-90 campers each summer and we employ almost 50 staff members. So, our camper:counselor ratio is nearly 2:1. The camper:counselor ratio in each tent is 4:1.

			</p>

			<strong>How do I communicate with my son during the summer?</strong>
			<p>
			Hand-written letters! Each camper's "ticket" to Sunday dinner is a letter home. Staff members help any boy who needs help writing letters. A mail boat comes to the island six days a week to pick up and drop off mail.
			</p>

			<strong>Can I send my son care packages?</strong>
